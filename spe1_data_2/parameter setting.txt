%% Set up the problem
% Because several examples use the SPE1 dataset, the initial setup is
% delegated to a helper function. See the inside for documentation.
[G, rock, fluid, deck, state] = setupSPE1();

p = gaussianField(G.cartDims, [0.2 0.4], 11, 1);
K = p.^3.*(1e-5)^2./(0.81*72*(1-p).^2);
rock = makeRock(G, K(:), p(:));
