Introduction
This Github page is for LSTM and MSRT learning on the co2 sequestration

Data are collected in data, spe1_data_1, spe1_data_2, spe1_data_3 files

Clustered LSTM codes are collected in Clustered_LSTM file



Outcome
Main Evaluations:
1. Computational Accuracy
    a) Root Mean Sqaure Error & Accuracy
        Without Clustering, the accuracy is range in 94%-96%
        With Clustering in 15 clusters, the accuracy is range in 90%-94%
    b) Mean Absolute Error & Accuracy
        Without Clustering, the accuracy is range in 97%-98%
        With Clustering in 15 clusters, the accuracy is range in 96%-97%

2. Computational Time (in seconds)
    Without Clustering: 14s-20s
    With Clustering in 15 clusters: <1s
    MRST: 25s or 35s
